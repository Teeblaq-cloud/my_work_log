**Author:** Olaifa Timileyin James  
**Timeline:** Month 1 of 4 (Full Stack Developer Program)  
**Focus:** Frontend + Backend Development Foundations

## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains a detailed log of my first month as a full stack web developer in training. It documents what I learned, what I built, and how I overcame key challenges across both **frontend** and **backend** technologies.

This worklog reflects my journey from foundational concepts to real, working projects — a portfolio in progress.

## 📚 Key Learnings

- **Frontend is about visual clarity,** backend is about logical clarity. I learned to respect both.  
- Asynchronous JavaScript (promises & fetch) can be tricky, but with enough debugging, patterns emerge.  
- Connecting frontend inputs to backend logic taught me to **think like a system**, not just a coder.  
- I developed confidence in reading documentation and asking better questions.

## 🔍 Challenges Faced

| Challenge | What I Did |
|----------|------------|
| Async API bugs | Used `console.log()` extensively and broke down logic into steps |
| React state management | Built mini component examples to isolate the logic |
| Merge conflicts | Learned how to resolve and avoid them through proper Git flow |
| Staying consistent | Developed a daily routine and project board on GitHub |

---

## ✨ Month 1 Highlights

- ✅ Built and deployed 3 projects  
- ✅ Joined a dev community and peer-reviewed code  
- ✅ Documented all projects with READMEs and screenshots  
- ✅ Started using GitHub Project Boards for task tracking

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Month 2 Goals)

- Learn React Hooks, context, and routing  
- Explore MongoDB and Mongoose  
- Build authentication and protected routes  
- Start working on a capstone full-stack app
